>"You will have the product name and total stock and all the variant combinations listed below"
1. If you want to add stock quantity to the current stock quantity then use the first input field which is **Restock (+Qty)**, if the stock of the variant is 20 and you write 5 in this input field and click **Restock** button then the stock for that variant becomes **25**.
2. If you want to directly update the stock and completely overwrite then use the second input field, by providing a number here like if the stock of the variant is 5, and you provide **20** here, then the stock will completely be replaced, and it will become **20**.

> "If the product variant has low stock there will be **Low Stock** alert in red color."
